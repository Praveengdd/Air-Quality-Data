1. Project Title and Description

Air Quality Analysis in Indian Cities
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on air quality data from various Indian cities. The analysis aims to uncover trends and insights in air quality metrics, including PM2.5, PM10, and AQI levels, with specific case studies focusing on cities like Bengaluru and Delhi.

2. Dataset Description

The dataset contains 24-hour air quality measurements taken between January 2015 and July 2020. The data has been structured into daily averages, spanning 30 cities across India, with fields for PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and AQI severity levels (AQI_Bucket).

3. Visualizations Included

* Overall Air Quality Trends: Plots showing AQI distribution over time for the entire dataset.
* Case Studies: Specific visualizations for Bengaluru and Delhi, highlighting city-specific air quality trends.
* Correlation Analysis: Heatmap displaying correlations among various air quality metrics.
* Category Distributions: Breakdown of AQI severity levels in different cities.
* Trend and Seasonality Analysis: Visual representation of how air quality varies by month and year.
