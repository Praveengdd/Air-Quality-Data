      <h1>Overview of Air Quality</h1>
      <p>
        The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized measure used to
        communicate the level of air pollution in a particular location, helping
        people understand how polluted the air is and what potential health
        effects might arise. The AQI considers the concentrations of various
        pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10),
        nitrogen oxides (NO, NOx, and NO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO),
        sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds like
        benzene, toluene, and xylene. Each pollutant's concentration is scaled
        and translated into an index score ranging from 0 to 500, with higher
        values indicating poorer air quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AQI calculation involves converting pollutant concentrations into
        individual sub-indices, which reflect the health effects of that
        pollutant. The highest of these sub-indices becomes the overall AQI
        value for a location, categorizing air quality into buckets, such as
        “Good,” “Moderate,” “Poor,” “Very Poor,” and “Severe.” This
        categorization enables residents to quickly gauge air quality and assess
        any associated health risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Air quality in India has been deteriorating significantly over the
        years. In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), I utilized a historical
        dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains over 700,000 hourly
        pollutant readings for major cities across India, including Delhi,
        Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Chennai, and Kolkata. This EDA focuses on three
        main areas: overall analysis of air quality across India, a case study
        on Bengaluru, and a case study on Delhi. Through various visualizations,
        I examined the variation of key pollutants from 2015 to 2020, as well as
        the relationships between major pollutants that negatively impact air
        quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        To streamline the analysis and improve visualization clarity, I
        converted the original dataset into daily and monthly datasets,
        containing approximately 29,000 and 4,200 entries, respectively. This
        aggregation simplified the plotting process and helped reduce missing
        values, which were imputed with appropriate mean or mode values for each
        column. Analyzing the complete dataset with 700,000 entries would have
        been resource-intensive and less practical, making this conversion an
        essential step for more efficient and insightful EDA.

      <h1>Overall Air Quality Analysis for India</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, I’ve included four visualizations to analyze air
        quality across major cities in India:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Median AQI Bar Graph</strong>: This bar chart illustrates the
          median AQI values across key cities, helping to compare overall air
          quality levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pollutant Correlation Heatmap</strong>: The heatmap shows the
          correlation between different pollutants, providing insights into how
          these pollutants may influence each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PM2.5 Variation Line Plot</strong>: This line plot captures
          the variations in PM2.5 levels over time for a selection of cities,
          highlighting trends in one of the primary pollutants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subplots for AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 Relationships</strong>:
          These scatter plots examine the relationships among AQI, PM2.5, and
          PM10 levels, offering a deeper view into how these pollutants interact
          and affect air quality across India.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Median AQI For Major Indian Cities.</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Overall/MedianAQI.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="medianImage"
      />
      <p>
        This plot illustrates the median AQI index for the cities of Delhi,
        Mumbai, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Chennai, Patna, Gurugram,
        Visakhapatnam, and Amritsar. The choice of median over mean is
        intentional; the dataset contains several outliers that can skew the
        mean significantly. Thus, using the median provides a more accurate
        representation of the central tendency in this context.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> From the graph, it is evident that Delhi has
        the highest median AQI among the cities over the years. Additionally,
        cities such as Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow also exhibit median AQI
        values above 200, indicating poor air quality. In contrast, the
        remaining cities have median AQI values that hover around 100,
        suggesting relatively better air quality.
      </p>

      <h2>Correlation Heatmap for the Pollutants.</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Overall/CorrelationMat.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="corMat"
      />

      <p>
        This plot is based on a correlation matrix visualized using a Seaborn
        heatmap. To enhance clarity, I employed a NumPy mask to hide the values
        in the upper triangle of the matrix. In the heatmap, a deeper red color
        indicates a strong correlation between pollutants, while a deeper blue
        signifies a weaker correlation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> From the heatmap, we observe that PM2.5 and
        PM10 exhibit the highest positive correlation of 0.85, which is expected
        since both are particulate matter. Additionally, the AQI shows a strong
        correlation with PM10 (0.80), PM2.5 (0.66), CO (0.68), and NO2 (0.54).
        This suggests that AQI is significantly influenced by these pollutants;
        thus, when their concentrations are elevated in a city, the AQI for that
        location is likely to be high.
      </p>

      <h2>Variation of PM2.5 Levels Over the Years</h2>
      <div class="scrolable">
        <img
          src="Plots/Overall/PM2.5Subplot.png"
          alt="Not available"
          class="sb1"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        This subplot consists of line plots depicting the variation of PM2.5
        levels over the years for the cities of Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, and
        Lucknow. These cities were selected due to the absence of consistent
        PM2.5 data for other major cities (e.g., Mumbai, Chennai), where
        readings either began later or were not recorded at all. Filling in
        missing values with the median would have resulted in a flat line plot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> From the plots, it is evident that Delhi
        records PM2.5 levels around 300 µg/m³, followed by Lucknow at
        approximately 250 µg/m³. Bengaluru shows lower levels at around 70
        µg/m³, while Hyderabad's PM2.5 levels are approximately 120 µg/m³.
        Notably, the graphs indicate a dip in PM2.5 levels during the mid-year
        months of June, July, and August, which can be attributed to the monsoon
        and rainy seasons. Rain acts as a cleansing agent in the atmosphere,
        significantly reducing pollutant levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Relationship Between PM2.5, PM10, and AQI</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Overall/pollutantRelation.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="pr"
      />
      <p>
        I have utilized Seaborn scatterplots to create three subplots that
        illustrate the relationship between PM2.5, PM10, and AQI across major
        cities in India.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> From the graphs, it is evident that AQI has a
        high positive correlation with PM10 compared to PM2.5. Additionally,
        PM2.5 also shares a positive correlation with PM10, as both are types of
        particulate matter. This relationship is further demonstrated by the
        positive correlation observed between PM2.5 and PM10 in the third plot.

      <h1>Case Study On Bengaluru</h1>

      <p>
        Bengaluru, often referred to as the "Silicon Valley of India," is a
        vibrant metropolis known for its booming technology industry and rich
        cultural heritage. Nestled in the southern part of India, it is one of
        the largest cities in the country and serves as a major hub for
        information technology, aerospace, and biotechnology. The city's
        elevation at approximately 3,000 feet above sea level contributes to its
        moderate climate, characterized by mild summers and cooler winters. With
        its lush green parks and gardens, Bengaluru is often celebrated for its
        pleasant weather, making it a popular destination for both residents and
        tourists alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the rapid urbanization and population growth in Bengaluru have
        led to significant challenges, particularly concerning air quality. The
        city's air quality has been a growing concern, with increasing levels of
        pollutants such as Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Particulate Matter
        (PM10), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2). These
        pollutants can have detrimental effects on public health and the
        environment. Weather patterns, including seasonal changes, also play a
        crucial role in air quality fluctuations, with monsoon rains often
        helping to temporarily alleviate pollution levels. Nonetheless, the
        overall air quality in Bengaluru requires ongoing monitoring and
        effective management strategies to ensure a healthier living environment
        for its residents.
      </p>

      <p>For Bengaluru, I have plotted five visualizations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Variation Plot:</strong> Variation of Particulate Matter
          (PM2.5), Particulate Matter (PM10), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Sulphur
          Dioxide (SO2) over the years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violin Plot:</strong> Violin plot for pollutants in Bengaluru.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Histogram:</strong> Histogram for the Distribution of Air
          Quality Index (AQI) severity buckets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scatter Plot:</strong> Scatter plot for the relationship
          between PM2.5 and PM10 with AQI bucket as hue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pair Plot:</strong> Pair plot for AQI, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 to
          understand the relationships.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Variation of PM2.5, PM10, CO and SO2</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Bengaluru/pollutantsVariation.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="pVar"
      />
      <p>
        I have plotted line plots to observe the variation of pollutants:
        Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Particulate Matter (PM10), Carbon Monoxide
        (CO), and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) over the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> From the graph, we can see that pollutant
        levels were significantly higher in 2016 and 2017 compared to 2018,
        2019, and 2020. The notable drop in pollutant levels in the subsequent
        years can be attributed to various factors, including policy changes
        aimed at reducing emissions and the increased awareness of air quality
        issues. Additionally, the relationship between PM2.5 and PM10 is
        evident, as both are types of particulate matter that often exhibit
        similar trends in concentration.
      </p>

      <h2>Violin Plot for Pollutants and AQI</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Bengaluru/violinPlot.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="vp"
      />
      <p>
        I have plotted a violin plot for the recorded pollutant values in
        Bengaluru on a daily basis. Note that I have excluded the pollutant
        Xylene from the analysis, as there were no observations recorded for it
        in Bengaluru. This plot provides a comprehensive visualization of the
        distribution, quartiles, and central tendencies for each pollutant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> From the plot, we can see that the violin
        plots for PM10 and AQI are almost similar, indicating a high correlation
        between them. The Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) graph is prominently
        centered around the range of 75 to 100 for the AQI violin plot,
        suggesting that a significant portion of the data falls within this
        range. Additionally, we can observe a substantial amount of Nitrogen
        Oxides (NOx) present in the air, which is likely attributable to the
        high volume of vehicles in Bengaluru.
      </p>

      <h2>Histogram for AQI Buckets Distribution</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Bengaluru/severitiesDistribution.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="bucketDis"
      />
      <p>
        I have plotted a histogram that counts how many instances fall into each
        category within the dataset. Additionally, I have included a Kernel
        Density Estimate (KDE) curve to provide a smoothed representation of
        this distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> The histogram reveals that the majority of
        AQI instances for Bengaluru fall within the "Satisfactory" and
        "Moderate" categories, with a noticeable portion also categorized as
        "Good." While there are only a few instances in the "Poor" category, it
        is reassuring to see minimal counts in the "Severe" and "Very Poor"
        categories. However, this should not be a reason for complacency, as
        continued efforts are necessary to maintain and improve air quality.
      </p>

      <h2>Relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 for different Buckets</h2>
      <img src="Plots/Bengaluru/hueplot.png" alt="Not available" class="hp" />

      <p>
        I have plotted a scatterplot illustrating the relationship between PM2.5
        and PM10, using the AQI bucket as the hue.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> As expected, there is a positive correlation
        between PM2.5 and PM10, indicating that higher levels of one pollutant
        are associated with higher levels of the other. The majority of the data
        points fall within the "Moderate" and "Satisfactory" AQI buckets, which
        aligns with our observations from the previous plot.
      </p>

      <h2>Pairplot for AQI, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2</h2>

      <img
        src="Plots/Bengaluru/pairplot.png"
        alt="Not available"
        class="pplt"
      />
      <p>
        I have plotted a pairplot for the columns AQI, PM10, PM2.5, and Sulphur
        Dioxide (SO2).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> As observed in the previous plots, PM2.5,
        PM10, and AQI all exhibit positive correlations with one another.
        However, SO2 does not show significant correlation with AQI, PM2.5, or
        PM10, indicating that the levels of Sulphur Dioxide may not be as
        closely linked to overall air quality as the particulate matters.
      </p>

      <h2>Overall Summary for Bengaluru Case Study Plots</h2>
      <p>
        In the Bengaluru case study, five visualizations were created to
        comprehensively analyze air quality metrics. The Variation of
        Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Particulate Matter (PM10), Carbon Monoxide
        (CO), and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) over the years shows fluctuations in
        pollutant levels, revealing elevated concentrations in 2016 and 2017
        compared to subsequent years. The analysis underscores a consistent
        relationship between PM2.5 and PM10 due to their shared particulate
        nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Violin Plot visualizes daily pollutant distributions, indicating
        that PM10 and AQI are closely related, with a significant presence of
        nitrogen oxides likely attributable to heavy vehicular traffic.
        Meanwhile, the Histogram for AQI Severity Distribution demonstrates that
        most instances fall within satisfactory and moderate categories, with
        minimal counts in the severe and very poor ranges, highlighting a
        generally positive air quality scenario despite some concerns.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Scatter Plot, which examines the relationship between PM2.5 and PM10
        using AQI buckets as hue, reinforces the positive correlation between
        these pollutants, predominantly falling into moderate and satisfactory
        categories. Lastly, the Pair Plot illustrates the interrelationships
        among AQI, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2, confirming strong positive correlations
        among the first three, while SO2 displays a weaker association,
        suggesting that it may not significantly influence overall air quality
        in Bengaluru.

      <h1>Case Study On Delhi</h1>

      <p>
        Delhi, the capital city of India, is a vibrant metropolis known for its
        rich history, diverse culture, and modern infrastructure. It is home to
        numerous historical landmarks, bustling markets, and a rapidly growing
        population that contributes to its status as one of the largest urban
        centers in the country. The city is a political, economic, and cultural
        hub, attracting people from all walks of life. However, this urban
        sprawl also presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of
        environmental sustainability and public health.
      </p>

      <p>
        Air quality in Delhi has raised considerable concerns over the years, as
        the city often experiences severe pollution levels, especially during
        the winter months. Factors contributing to this air quality crisis
        include vehicular emissions, industrial discharges, construction dust,
        and the burning of biomass in surrounding areas. As a result, Delhi
        frequently records high levels of Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10),
        leading to adverse health effects on its residents. The situation calls
        for urgent action to address the sources of pollution and implement
        effective air quality management strategies to safeguard public health
        and the environment.
      </p>

      <p>Similar to Bengaluru, I have plotted five visualizations on Delhi:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Line Plot</strong> to show variations of PM10, PM2.5, CO, and
          SO2 levels in Delhi over the years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pie Chart</strong> that shows the distribution of AQI buckets
          in Delhi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Line Plot</strong> to observe the variation of Oxides of
          Nitrogen in Delhi from March 2020 to April 2020.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Histogram</strong> to see the distribution of AQI in Delhi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Joint Plot</strong> between PM2.5 and PM10 with AQI bucket as
          hue.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Variation of PM2.5, PM10, CO and SO2</h2>
      <img
        src="Plots/Delhi/pollutantVariation.png"
        alt="Not Available"
        class="pVar"
      />
      <p>
        I have plotted the variations in the levels of PM10, PM2.5, Carbon
        Monoxide (CO), and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) over the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> The levels of PM2.5 and PM10 exhibit similar
        rising and falling patterns throughout the years. As observed in
        Bengaluru, during the middle of the year, pollutant levels decrease
        significantly due to the rains and monsoons, which act as natural
        cleansers. Additionally, people tend to use their vehicles less during
        this time, contributing to lower pollutant levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Pie Chart For Distribution Of AQI Buckets</h2>
      <img src="Plots/Delhi/pieChart.png" alt="Not Available" class="pie" />
      <p>
        The pie chart is plotted to show the distribution of Air Quality Index
        (AQI) buckets in Delhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> Over the years, we observe that approximately
        75% of the chart is covered by the "Very Poor" (26.9%), "Poor" (26%),
        and "Moderate" (25.6%) categories, which is a concerning trend.
        Furthermore, around 12% of the data falls into the "Severe" bucket,
        indicating significant health risks for the population. Alarmingly, only
        about 10% of the chart represents the "Good" and "Satisfactory"
        categories, highlighting a pressing need for effective air quality
        management. This distribution raises serious concerns about the ongoing
        air pollution crisis in Delhi, as sustained exposure to poor air quality
        can lead to severe health issues for its residents.

      <h2>Variation of Oxides of Nitrogen in March 2020</h2>
      <img src="Plots/Delhi/Lockdown.png" alt="Not Available" class="ld" />
      <p>
        I have plotted the line plot to analyze the variation in the Air Quality
        Index (AQI) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) during March 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> On March 21st, the AQI was around 200,
        indicating a significant level of pollution. However, after the lockdown
        was imposed on the same day, the AQI significantly dropped to around 50.
        This change highlights the immediate impact of reduced vehicular
        emissions due to the lockdown. Similarly, the levels of oxides of
        nitrogen also fell, reflecting the decrease in traffic as people were
        restricted from using their vehicles. This data underscores the
        potential for improving air quality through reduced pollution
        activities.
      </p>

      <h2>Distribution of AQI in Delhi</h2>

      <p>
        I have plotted a histogram to show the distribution of Air Quality Index
        (AQI) values in Delhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> Although the AQI can reach a maximum of 500,
        values above that indicate outliers present in the dataset. The
        histogram reveals that a significant proportion of AQI values in Delhi
        fall within the categories of 200, 300, and 350. This distribution is
        concerning as it reflects a persistent level of air pollution that poses
        serious health risks to the population. The high frequency of AQI values
        in these categories suggests that many residents are consistently
        exposed to unhealthy air quality, which can lead to long-term health
        complications, especially for vulnerable groups such as children and the
        elderly.
      </p>

      <h2>Joint plot for PM10 and PM2.5</h2>
      <img src="Plots/Delhi/jointPlot.png" alt="Not Available" class="jp" />
      <p>
        I have created a joint plot that illustrates the relationship between
        PM10 and PM2.5, along with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot, using
        AQI buckets as hue.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analysis:</strong> The joint plot reveals that the majority of
        points fall within the Severe, Poor, Very Poor, and Moderate categories.
        This is a significant concern as it indicates that a large portion of
        the population is exposed to unhealthy air quality levels. In contrast
        to Bengaluru, where the majority of points were categorized as Moderate
        and Satisfactory, Delhi's air quality situation appears more dire. The
        KDE plots further emphasize this discrepancy, highlighting the need for
        immediate action to address the high levels of air pollution affecting
        the city.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary of Delhi’s Air Quality Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The five visualizations presented provide a comprehensive overview of
        the air quality situation in Delhi, emphasizing the critical pollutants
        and their variations over time. The line plot illustrating the
        fluctuations of PM10, PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Sulphur Dioxide
        (SO2) levels from 2016 to 2020 reveals similar trends for PM2.5 and
        PM10, with significant drops observed during the monsoon months,
        indicating the natural cleansing effects of rainfall on air quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pie chart depicting the distribution of Air Quality Index (AQI)
        buckets raises alarm bells, as approximately 75% of the observations
        fall into the Very Poor, Poor, and Moderate categories. This concerning
        distribution highlights the persistent air quality challenges faced by
        the city, with around 12% categorized as Severe, and only a minimal
        share representing Good and Satisfactory levels. Such a distribution
        underscores the urgent need for effective air quality management
        strategies to address the ongoing pollution crisis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The line plot focused on the variation of AQI and oxides of nitrogen
        during March 2020 showcases a dramatic decrease in AQI from around 200
        to 50 following the lockdown imposed on March 21. This significant
        decline correlates with a reduction in the levels of oxides of nitrogen,
        illustrating the positive impact of reduced vehicular traffic on air
        quality. The histogram reveals that the majority of AQI values cluster
        around 200, 300, and 350, raising concerns about the high frequency of
        poor air quality days. Finally, the joint plot establishes a connection
        between PM10 and PM2.5 levels, showing a worrying predominance of data
        points in the Severe, Poor, Very Poor, and Moderate categories, which
        calls for immediate intervention and policy measures.
